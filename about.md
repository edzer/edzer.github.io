I am a professor at the [institute for
geoinformatics](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/en) of the [University of
MÃ¼nster](http://www.uni-muenster.de/en/). My research interests include
the computational and statistical modelling of spatio-temporal
phenomena, at the geographical scale.

I develop software packages for
[R](http:/www.r-project.org/), related to handling and
analyzing spatial data, and spatial statistics. A list of
[CRAN](https://cran.uni-muenster.de) packages I maintain is found
[here](http://www.r-pkg.org/maint/edzer.pebesma@uni-muenster.de).
